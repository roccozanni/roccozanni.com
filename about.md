This is a simple website I use to host some information about myself and some notes about coding.

I'm an Italian software developer and I live in Berlin, Germany since 2013. I'm one of the co-founders
of [Spreaker](http://www.spreaker.com), a web and mobile community for broadcasters, publishers and musicians.
